$00000001 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_EN                              \ SAES enable This bit enables/disables the SAES peripheral: At any moment, clearing then setting the bit re-initializes the SAES peripheral. This bit is automatically cleared by hardware upon the completion of the key preparation (Mode 2) and upon the completion of GCM/GMAC/CCM initial phase. The bit cannot be set as long as KEYVALID = 0 nor along with the following settings: KMOD = 01 + CHMOD = 011 and KMOD = 01 + CHMOD = 010 + MODE = 00. Note: With KMOD[1:0] other than 00, use the IPRST bit rather than the bit EN.
$00000006 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_DATATYPE                        \ Data type selection This bitfield defines the format of data written in the SAES_DINR register or read from the SAES_DOUTR register, through selecting the mode of data swapping: For more details, refer to . Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$00000018 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_MODE                            \ SAES operating mode This bitfield selects the SAES operating mode: Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$00000060 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_CHMOD1                          \ Chaining mode selection This bitfield selects the AES chaining mode: others: Reserved Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$00000800 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_DMAINEN                         \ DMA input enable This bit enables/disables data transferring with DMA, in the input phase: When the bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by SAES during the input data phase. This feature is only effective when Mode 1 or Mode 3 is selected through the MODE[1:0] bitfield. It is not effective for Mode 2 (key derivation).
$00001000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_DMAOUTEN                        \ DMA output enable This bit enables/disables data transferring with DMA, in the output phase: When the bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by SAES during the output data phase. This feature is only effective when Mode 1 or Mode 3 is selected through the MODE[1:0] bitfield. It is not effective for Mode 2 (key derivation).
$00006000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_GCMPH                           \ GCM or CCM phase selection This bitfield selects the phase of GCM, GMAC or CCM algorithm: The bitfield has no effect if other than GCM, GMAC or CCM algorithms are selected (through the ALGOMODE bitfield).
$00010000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_CHMOD2                          \ Chaining mode selection This bitfield selects the AES chaining mode: others: Reserved Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$00040000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_KEYSIZE                         \ Key size selection This bitfield defines the length of the key used in the SAES cryptographic core, in bits: When KMOD[1:0]=01 or 10 KEYSIZE also defines the length of the key to encrypt or decrypt. Attempts to write the bit are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$00080000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_KEYPROT                         \ Key protection When set, hardware-based key protection is enabled. Attempts to write the bit are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$00f00000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_NPBLB                           \ Number of padding bytes in last block The bitfield sets the number of padding bytes in last block of payload: ...
$03000000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_KMOD                            \ Key mode selection The bitfield defines how the SAES key can be used by the application: Others: Reserved With normal key selection, the key registers are freely usable, no specific usage or protection applies to SAES_DIN and SAES_DOUT registers. With wrapped key selection, the key loaded in key registers can only be used to encrypt or decrypt AES keys. Hence, when a decryption is selected in Wrapped-key mode read-as-zero SAES_DOUT register is automatically loaded into SAES key registers after a successful decryption process. With shared key selection, after a successful decryption process, SAES key registers are shared with the peripheral described in KSHAREID(1:0] bitfield. This sharing is valid only while KMOD[1:0]=10 and KEYVALID = 1. When a decryption is selected, read-as-zero SAES_DOUT register is automatically loaded into SAES key registers after a successful decryption process. With KMOD[1:0] other than zero, any attempt to configure the SAES peripheral for use by an application belonging to a different security domain (secure or non-secure) results in automatic key erasure and setting of the KEIF flag.\nAttempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$0c000000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_KSHAREID                        \ Key share identification This bitfield defines, at the end of a decryption process with KMOD[1:0]=10 (shared key), which target can read the SAES key registers using a dedicated hardware bus. Others: Reserved Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$70000000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_KEYSEL                          \ Key selection The bitfield defines the source of the key information to use in the AES cryptographic core. Others: Reserved (if used, unfreeze SAES with IPRST) When KEYSEL is different from zero, selected key value is available in key registers when BUSY bit is cleared and KEYVALID is set in the SAES_SR register. Otherwise, the key error flag KEIF is set. Repeated writing of KEYSEL[2:0] with the same non-zero value only triggers the loading of DHUK or BHK if KEYVALID = 0. When the application software changes the key selection by writing the KEYSEL[2:0] bitfield, the key registers are immediately erased and the KEYVALID flag cleared. At the end of the decryption process, if KMOD[1:0] is other than zero, KEYSEL[2:0] is cleared. With the bitfield value other than zero and KEYVALID set, the application cannot transfer the ownership of SAES with a loaded key to an application running in another security context (such as secure, non-secure). More specifically, when security of an access to any register does not match the information recorded by SAES, the KEIF flag is set. Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
$80000000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_CR_IPRST                           \ SAES peripheral software reset Setting the bit resets the SAES peripheral, putting all registers to their default values, except the IPRST bit itself and the SAES_DPACFG register. Hence, any key-relative data is lost. For this reason, it is recommended to set the bit before handing over the SAES to a less secure application. The bit must be low while writing any configuration registers.

$00000001 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_SR_CCF                             \ Computation completed flag This bit mirrors the CCF bit of the SAES_ISR register.
$00000002 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_SR_RDERR                           \ Read error flag This flag indicates the detection of an unexpected read operation from the SAES_DOUTR register (during computation or data input phase): The flag is set by hardware. It is cleared by software upon setting the RWEIF bit of the SAES_ICR register. Upon the flag setting, an interrupt is generated if enabled through the RWEIE bit of the SAES_ICR register. The flag setting has no impact on the SAES operation. Unexpected read returns zero.
$00000004 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_SR_WRERR                           \ Write error This flag indicates the detection of an unexpected write operation to the SAES_DINR register (during computation or data output phase): The flag is set by hardware. It is cleared by software upon setting the RWEIF bit of the SAES_ICR register. Upon the flag setting, an interrupt is generated if enabled through the RWEIE bit of the SAES_ICR register. The flag setting has no impact on the SAES operation. Unexpected write is ignored.
$00000008 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_SR_BUSY                            \ Busy This flag indicates whether SAES is idle or busy during GCM payload encryption phase: The flag is set upon SAES initialization, upon fetching random number from the RNG, or upon transferring a shared key to a target peripheral. When GCM encryption is selected, the flag must be at zero before selecting the GCM final phase.
$00000080 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_SR_KEYVALID                        \ Key Valid flag This bit is set by hardware when the amount of key information defined by KEYSIZE in SAES_CR has been loaded in SAES_KEYx key registers. In normal mode when KEYSEL equals to zero, the application must write the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag of the SAES_ISR register is set and KEYVALID stays at zero. When KEYSEL is different from zero the BUSY flag is automatically set by SAES. When key is loaded successfully, the BUSY flag is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, the KEIF flag of the SAES_ISR register is set, the BUSY flag cleared and KEYVALID kept at zero. When the KEIF flag is set, the application must clear it through the SAES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF bit description for more details.

$00000000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_DINR_DIN                           \ Input data word A four-fold sequential write to this bitfield during the input phase results in writing a complete 128-bit block of input data to the SAES peripheral. From the first to the fourth write, the corresponding data weights are [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0]. Upon each write, the data from the 32-bit input buffer are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield, then written into the AES core 128-bit input buffer. The data signification of the input data block depends on the SAES operating mode: - Mode 1 (encryption): plaintext - Mode 2 (key derivation): the bitfield is not used (SAES_KEYRx registers used for input if KEYSEL=0) - Mode 3 (decryption): ciphertext The data swap operation is described in on page 1149.

$00000000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_DOUTR_DOUT                         \ Output data word This read-only bitfield fetches a 32-bit output buffer. A four-fold sequential read of this bitfield, upon the computation completion (CCF set), virtually reads a complete 128-bit block of output data from the SAES peripheral. Before reaching the output buffer, the data produced by the AES core are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield. Data weights from the first to the fourth read operation are: [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0]. The data signification of the output data block depends on the SAES operating mode: - Mode 1 (encryption): ciphertext - Mode 2 (key derivation): the bitfield is not used - Mode 3 (decryption): plaintext The data swap operation is described in on page 1149.

$00000000 constant SEC_SAES_SAES_KEYR0_KEY                          \ Cryptographic key, bits [31:0] This write-only bitfield contains the bits [31:0] of the AES encryption or decryption key, depending on the operating mode: - In Mode 1 (encryption), Mode 2 (key derivation): the value to write into the bitfield is the encryption key. - In Mode 3 (decryption): the value to write into the bitfield is the encryption key to be derived before being used for decryption. The SAES_KEYRx registers may be written only when KEYSIZE value is correct and when the SAES peripheral is disabled (EN bit of the SAES_CR register cleared). A special writing sequence is also required, as described in KEYVALID bit of the SAES_SR register. Note that, if KEYSEL is different from 0 and KEYVALID = 0, the key is directly loaded to SAES_KEYRx registers (hence writes to key register is ignored and KEIF is set). Refer to for more details.
