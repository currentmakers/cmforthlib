    $00 constant AES_EN                         \ [0x00] AES enable This bit enables/disables the AES peripheral: At any moment, clearing then setting the bit re-initializes the AES peripheral. This bit is automatically cleared by hardware upon the completion of the key preparation (Mode 2) and upon the completion of GCM/GMAC/CCM initial phase. The bit cannot be set as long as KEYVALID = 0. Note: With KMOD[1:0] other than 00, use the IPRST bit rather than the bit EN.
    $01 constant AES_DATATYPE                   \ [0x01 : 2] Data type selection This bitfield defines the format of data written in the AES_DINR register or read from the AES_DOUTR register, through selecting the mode of data swapping: For more details, refer to . Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of AES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the AES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
    $03 constant AES_MODE                       \ [0x03 : 2] AES operating mode This bitfield selects the AES operating mode: Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of AES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the AES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
    $05 constant AES_CHMOD1                     \ [0x05 : 2] Chaining mode selection This bitfield selects the AES chaining mode: others: Reserved Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of AES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the AES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
    $0b constant AES_DMAINEN                    \ [0x0b] DMA input enable This bit enables/disables data transferring with DMA, in the input phase: When the bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by AES during the input data phase. This feature is only effective when Mode 1 or Mode 3 is selected through the MODE[1:0] bitfield. It is not effective for Mode 2 (key derivation).
    $0c constant AES_DMAOUTEN                   \ [0x0c] DMA output enable This bit enables/disables data transferring with DMA, in the output phase: When the bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by AES during the output data phase. This feature is only effective when Mode 1 or Mode 3 is selected through the MODE[1:0] bitfield. It is not effective for Mode 2 (key derivation).
    $0d constant AES_GCMPH                      \ [0x0d : 2] GCM or CCM phase selection This bitfield selects the phase of GCM, GMAC or CCM algorithm: The bitfield has no effect if other than GCM, GMAC or CCM algorithms are selected (through the ALGOMODE bitfield).
    $10 constant AES_CHMOD2                     \ [0x10] Chaining mode selection This bitfield selects the AES chaining mode: others: Reserved Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of AES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the AES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
    $12 constant AES_KEYSIZE                    \ [0x12] Key size selection This bitfield defines the length of the key used in the AES cryptographic core, in bits: Attempts to write the bit are ignored when the BUSY flag of AES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the AES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
    $14 constant AES_NPBLB                      \ [0x14 : 4] Number of padding bytes in last block The bitfield sets the number of padding bytes in last block of payload: ...
    $18 constant AES_KMOD                       \ [0x18 : 2] Key mode selection The bitfield defines how the AES key can be used by the application: Others: Reserved With normal key selection, the key registers are freely usable, no specific usage or protection applies to AES_DIN and AES_DOUT registers. With selection of shared key from SAES co-processor, the AES peripheral automatically loads its key registers with the data stored in the key registers of the SAES peripheral. The key value is available in key registers when BUSY bit is cleared and KEYVALID is set in the AES_SR register. Key error flag KEIF is set otherwise in the AES_ISR register. The bitfield must be set only when KEYSIZE is correct, and when a shared key decryption sequence has been successfully completed in SAES co-processor. N/AAttempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of AES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the AES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
    $1f constant AES_IPRST                      \ [0x1f] AES peripheral software reset Setting the bit resets the AES peripheral, putting all registers to their default values, except the IPRST bit itself. Hence, any key-relative data is lost. For this reason, it is recommended to set the bit before handing over the AES to a less secure application. The bit must be low while writing any configuration registers.

    $00 constant AES_CCF                        \ [0x00] Computation completed flag This bit mirrors the CCF bit of the AES_ISR register.
    $01 constant AES_RDERR                      \ [0x01] Read error flag This flag indicates the detection of an unexpected read operation from the AES_DOUTR register (during computation or data input phase): The flag is set by hardware. It is cleared by software upon setting the RWEIF bit of the AES_ICR register. Upon the flag setting, an interrupt is generated if enabled through the RWEIE bit of the AES_ICR register. The flag setting has no impact on the AES operation. Unexpected read returns zero.
    $02 constant AES_WRERR                      \ [0x02] Write error This flag indicates the detection of an unexpected write operation to the AES_DINR register (during computation or data output phase): The flag is set by hardware. It is cleared by software upon setting the RWEIF bit of the AES_ICR register. Upon the flag setting, an interrupt is generated if enabled through the RWEIE bit of the AES_ICR register. The flag setting has no impact on the AES operation. Unexpected write is ignored.
    $03 constant AES_BUSY                       \ [0x03] Busy This flag indicates whether AES is idle or busy during GCM payload encryption phase: When the flag indicates 'idle', the current GCM encryption processing may be suspended to process a higher-priority message. In other chaining modes, or in GCM phases other than payload encryption, the flag must be ignored for the suspend process. The flag is set when transferring a shared key from SAES peripheral.
    $07 constant AES_KEYVALID                   \ [0x07] Key Valid flag This bit is set by hardware when the amount of key information defined by KEYSIZE in AES_CR has been loaded in AES_KEYx key registers. In normal mode when KEYSEL equals to zero, the application must write the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag of the AES_ISR register is set and KEYVALID stays at zero. When KEYSEL is different from zero the BUSY flag is automatically set by AES. When key is loaded successfully, the BUSY flag is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, the KEIF flag of the AES_ISR register is set, the BUSY flag cleared and KEYVALID kept at zero. When the KEIF flag is set, the application must clear it through the AES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF bit description for more details.

    $00 constant AES_DIN                        \ [0x00 : 32] Input data word A four-fold sequential write to this bitfield during the input phase results in writing a complete 128-bit block of input data to the AES peripheral. From the first to the fourth write, the corresponding data weights are [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0]. Upon each write, the data from the 32-bit input buffer are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield, then written into the AES core 128-bit input buffer. The data signification of the input data block depends on the AES operating mode: - Mode 1 (encryption): plaintext - Mode 2 (key derivation): the bitfield is not used (AES_KEYRx registers used for input) - Mode 3 (decryption): ciphertext The data swap operation is described in page 1149.

A four-fold sequential read of this bitfield, upon the computation completion (CCF set), virtually reads a complete 128-bit block of output data from the AES peripheral. Before reaching the output buffer, the data produced by the AES core are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield. Data weights from the first to the fourth read operation are: [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0]. The data signification of the output data block depends on the AES operating mode: - Mode 1 (encryption): ciphertext - Mode 2 (key derivation): the bitfield is not used - Mode 3 (decryption): plaintext The data swap operation is described in page 1149.

The AES_KEYRx registers may be written only when KEYSIZE value is correct and when the AES peripheral is disabled (EN bit of the AES_CR register cleared). A special writing sequence is also required, as described in KEYVALID bit of the AES_SR register. Note that, if KMOD[1:0] = 10 (shared key), the key is directly loaded from SAES peripheral to AES_KEYRx registers (hence writes to key register is ignored and KEIF is set). Refer to for more details.
