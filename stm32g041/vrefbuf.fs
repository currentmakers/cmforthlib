    $00 constant VREFBUF_ENVR                   \ [0x00] Voltage reference buffer mode enable This bit is used to enable the voltage reference buffer mode.
    $01 constant VREFBUF_HIZ                    \ [0x01] High impedance mode This bit controls the analog switch to connect or not the VREF+ pin. Refer to Table196: VREF buffer modes for the mode descriptions depending on ENVR bit configuration.
    $03 constant VREFBUF_VRR                    \ [0x03] Voltage reference buffer ready
    $04 constant VREFBUF_VRS                    \ [0x04 : 3] Voltage reference scale These bits select the value generated by the voltage reference buffer. Other: Reserved

    $00 constant VREFBUF_TRIM                   \ [0x00 : 6] Trimming code These bits are automatically initialized after reset with the trimming value stored in the Flash memory during the production test. Writing into these bits allows to tune the internal reference buffer voltage.
