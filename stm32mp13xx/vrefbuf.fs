    \ @brief VREFBUF control and status register

    $00 constant VREFBUF_ENVR                   \ [0x00] Voltage reference buffer mode enable This bit is used to enable the voltage reference buffer mode.
    $01 constant VREFBUF_HIZ                    \ [0x01] High impedance mode This bit controls the analog switch to connect or not the VREF+ pin. Refer to for the mode descriptions depending on ENVR bit configuration.
    $03 constant VREFBUF_VRR                    \ [0x03] Voltage reference buffer ready
    $04 constant VREFBUF_VRS                    \ [0x04 : 3] Voltage reference scale These bits select the value generated by the voltage reference buffer. VRS = 000: VREFBUF0 voltage selected. VRS = 001: VREFBUF1 voltage selected. VRS = 010: VREFBUF2 voltage selected. VRS = 011: VREFBUF3 voltage selected. Others: Reserved Note: Refer to the product datasheet for each VREFBUFx voltage setting value. The software can program this bitfield only when the VREFBUF is disabled (ENVR=0).

    \ @brief VREFBUF calibration control register
    \ Address offset: 0x04
    \ Reset value: 0x00000000
    \
    $00 constant VREFBUF_TRIM                   \ [0x00 : 6] Trimming code The TRIM code is a 6-bit unsigned data (minimum 000000, maximum 111111) that is set and updated according the mechanism described below. Reset: TRIM[5:0] is automatically initialized with the VRS = 0 trimming value stored in the Flash memory during the production test. VRS change: TRIM[5:0] is automatically initialized with the trimming value (corresponding to VRS setting) stored in the Flash memory during the production test. Write in TRIM[5:0]: User can modify the TRIM[5:0] with an arbitrary value. This is permanently disabling the control of the trimming value with VRS (until the device is reset). Note: If the user application performs the trimming, the trimming code must start from 000000 to 111111 in ascending order.
