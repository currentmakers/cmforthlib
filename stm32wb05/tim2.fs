The Update (UEV) event is generated by one of the following events: - Counter overflow/underflow - Setting the UG bit - Update generation through the slave mode controller Buffered registers are then loaded with their preload values. 1: UEV disabled. The Update event is not generated, shadow registers keep their value (ARR, PSC, CCRx). However the counter and the prescaler are reinitialized if the UG bit is set or if a hardware reset is received from the slave mode controller.

The counter counts up and down alternatively. Output compare interrupt flags of channels configured in output (CCxS=00 in TIMx_CCMRx register) are set only when the counter is counting up. 11: Center-aligned mode 3. The counter counts up and down alternatively. Output compare interrupt flags of channels configured in output (CCxS=00 in TIMx_CCMRx register) are set both when the counter is counting up or down. Note: It is not allowed to switch from edge-aligned mode to center-aligned mode as long as the counter is enabled (CEN=1)

This field is not available in IUM as Timer2 is not connected to ant other timer for master/slave synchronization. These bits allow to select the information to be sent in master mode to slave timers for synchronization (TRGO). The combination is as follow : is generated by the trigger input (slave mode controller configured in reset mode) then the signal on TRGO is delayed compared to the actual reset. start several timers at the same time or to control a window in which a slave timer is enable. The Counter Enable signal is generated by a logic OR between CEN control bit and the trigger input when configured in gated mode. When the Counter Enable signal is controlled by the trigger input, there is a delay on TRGO, except if the master/slave mode is selected (see the MSM bit description in GPT_SMCR register). can then be used as a prescaler for a slave timer. (even if it was already high), as soon as a capture or a compare match occured. (TRGO).

The counter stops (but is not reset) as soon as the trigger becomes low. Both start and stop of the counter are controlled. 0110: Trigger Mode - The counter starts at a rising edge of the trigger TRGI (but it is not reset). Only the start of the counter is controlled. 0111: External Clock Mode 1 - Rising edges of the selected trigger (TRGI) clock the counter. 1000: Combined reset + trigger mode - Rising edge of the selected trigger input (TRGI) reinitializes the counter, generates an update of the registers and starts the counter. Codes above 1000: Reserved. Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input (TS='100'). Indeed, TI1F_ED outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.

$00000080 constant TIM2_SMCR_MSM                                    \ MSM: Master/Slave mode Not vailable in IUM. Not used in Blue51 as TRGO is not connected to any slave timer 0: No action 1: The effect of an event on the trigger input (TRGI) is delayed to allow a perfect synchronization between the current timer and its slaves (through TRGO). It is useful if we want to synchronize several timers on a single external event.

A prescaler can be enabled to reduce ETRP frequency. It is useful when inputting fast external clocks. 00: Prescaler OFF 01: ETRP frequency divided by 2 10: ETRP frequency divided by 4 11: ETRP frequency divided by 8
$00004000 constant TIM2_SMCR_ECE                                    \ ECE: External clock enable This bit enables External clock mode 2. 0: External clock mode 2 disabled 1: External clock mode 2 enabled. The counter is clocked by any active edge on the ETRF signal. Note: 1: Setting the ECE bit has the same effect as selecting external clock mode 1 with TRGI connected to ETRF (SMS=111 and TS=111). Note: 2: It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, TRGI must not be connected to ETRF in this case (TS bits must not be 111). Note: 3: If external clock mode 1 and external clock mode 2 are enabled at the same time, the external clock input is ETRF.

OC1REFC is the logical OR between OC1REF and OC2REF. 1101: Combined PWM mode 2 - OC1REF has the same behavior as in PWM mode 2. OC1REFC is the logical AND between OC1REF and OC2REF 1110: Asymmetric PWM mode 1 - OC1REF has the same behavior as in PWM mode 1. OC1REFC outputs OC1REF when the counter is counting up, OC2REF when it is counting down. 1111: Asymmetric PWM mode 2 - OC1REF has the same behavior as in PWM mode 2.
