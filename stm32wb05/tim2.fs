The Update event is not generated, shadow registers keep their value (ARR, PSC, CCRx). However the counter and the prescaler are reinitialized if the UG bit is set or if a hardware reset is received from the slave mode controller.

Output compare interrupt flags of channels configured in output (CCxS=00 in TIMx_CCMRx register) are set only when the counter is counting up. 11: Center-aligned mode 3. The counter counts up and down alternatively. Output compare interrupt flags of channels configured in output (CCxS=00 in TIMx_CCMRx register) are set both when the counter is counting up or down.

The Counter Enable signal is generated by a logic OR between CEN control bit and the trigger input when configured in gated mode.

The counter stops (but is not reset) as soon as the trigger becomes low. Both start and stop of the counter are controlled. 0110: Trigger Mode - The counter starts at a rising edge of the trigger TRGI (but it is not reset). Only the start of the counter is controlled. 0111: External Clock Mode 1 - Rising edges of the selected trigger (TRGI) clock the counter. 1000: Combined reset + trigger mode - Rising edge of the selected trigger input (TRGI) reinitializes the counter, generates an update of the registers and starts the counter. Codes above 1000: Reserved. Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input (TS='100'). Indeed, TI1F_ED outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.

The counter is clocked by any active edge on the ETRF signal. Note: 1: Setting the ECE bit has the same effect as selecting external clock mode 1 with TRGI connected to ETRF (SMS=111 and TS=111). Note: 2: It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, TRGI must not be connected to ETRF in this case (TS bits must not be 111). Note: 3: If external clock mode 1 and external clock mode 2 are enabled at the same time, the external clock input is ETRF.
