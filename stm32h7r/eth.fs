$00000001 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_RE                                 \ Receiver Enable When this bit is set, the Rx state machine of the MAC is enabled for receiving packets from the MII interface. When this bit is reset, the MAC Rx state machine is disabled after it completes the reception of the current packet. The Rx state machine does not receive any more packets from the MII interface.
$00000002 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_TE                                 \ Transmitter Enable When this bit is set, the Tx state machine of the MAC is enabled for transmission on the MII interface. When this bit is reset, the MAC Tx state machine is disabled after it completes the transmission of the current packet. The Tx state machine does not transmit any more packets.
$0000000c constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_PRELEN                             \ Preamble Length for Transmit packets These bits control the number of preamble bytes that are added to the beginning of every Tx packet. The preamble reduction occurs only when the MAC is operating in the Full-duplex mode.
$00000010 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_DC                                 \ Deferral Check When this bit is set, the deferral check function is enabled in the MAC. The MAC issues a Packet Abort status, along with the excessive deferral error bit set in the Tx packet status, when the Tx state machine is deferred for more than 24,288 bit times in 10 or 100 Mbps mode. Deferral begins when the transmitter is ready to transmit, but it is prevented because of an active carrier sense signal (CRS) on MII. The defer time is not cumulative. For example, if the transmitter defers for 10,000 bit times because the CRS signal is active and the CRS signal becomes inactive, the transmitter transmits and collision happens. Because of collision, the transmitter needs to back off and then defer again after back off completion. In such a scenario, the deferral timer is reset to 0, and it is restarted. When this bit is reset, the deferral check function is disabled and the MAC defers until the CRS signal goes inactive. This bit is applicable only in the Half-duplex mode.
$00000060 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_BL                                 \ Back-Off Limit The back-off limit determines the random integer number (r) of slot time delays (512 bit times for 10/100 Mbps) for which the MAC waits before rescheduling a transmission attempt during retries after a collision: where n = retransmission attempt The random integer r takes the value in the range 0 <= r < 2^k. This bit is applicable only in the Half-duplex mode.
$00000100 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_DR                                 \ Disable Retry When this bit is set, the MAC attempts only one transmission. When a collision occurs on the MII interface, the MAC ignores the current packet transmission and reports a Packet Abort with excessive collision error in the Tx packet status. When this bit is reset, the MAC retries based on the settings of the BL field. This bit is applicable only in the Half-duplex mode.
$00000200 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_DCRS                               \ Disable Carrier Sense During Transmission When this bit is set, the MAC transmitter ignores the MII CRS signal during packet transmission in the Half-duplex mode. As a result, no errors are generated because of Loss of Carrier or No Carrier during transmission. When this bit is reset, the MAC transmitter generates errors because of Carrier Sense. The MAC can even abort the transmission.
$00000400 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_DO                                 \ Disable Receive Own When this bit is set, the MAC disables the reception of packets when the ETH_TX_EN is asserted in the Half-duplex mode. When this bit is reset, the MAC receives all packets given by the PHY. This bit is not applicable in the Full-duplex mode. This bit is reserved and read-only (RO) with default value in the Full-duplex-only configurations.
$00000800 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_ECRSFD                             \ Enable Carrier Sense Before Transmission in Full-duplex mode When this bit is set, the MAC transmitter checks the CRS signal before packet transmission in the Full-duplex mode. The MAC starts the transmission only when the CRS signal is low. When this bit is reset, the MAC transmitter ignores the status of the CRS signal.
$00001000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_LM                                 \ Loopback Mode When this bit is set, the MAC operates in the loopback mode at MII. The MII Rx clock input (eth_mii_rx_clk) is required for the loopback to work properly. This is because the Tx clock is not internally looped back.
$00002000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_DM                                 \ Duplex Mode When this bit is set, the MAC operates in the Full-duplex mode in which it can transmit and receive simultaneously.
$00004000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_FES                                \ MAC Speed This bit selects the speed in the 10/100 Mbps mode:
$00010000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_JE                                 \ Jumbo Packet Enable When this bit is set, the MAC allows jumbo packets of 9,018 bytes (9,022 bytes for VLAN tagged packets) without reporting a giant packet error in the Rx packet status. For more information about how the setting of this bit and the JE bit impact the Giant packet status, see Table 563: Giant Packet Status based on S2KP and JE Bits.
$00020000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_JD                                 \ Jabber Disable When this bit is set, the MAC disables the jabber timer on the transmitter. The MAC can transfer packets of up to 16,383 bytes. When this bit is reset, if the application sends more than 2,048 bytes of data (10,240 if JE is set high) during transmission, the MAC does not send rest of the bytes in that packet.
$00080000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_WD                                 \ Watchdog Disable When this bit is set, the MAC disables the watchdog timer on the receiver. The MAC can receive packets of up to 16,383 bytes. When this bit is reset, the MAC does not allow more than 2,048 bytes (10,240 if JE is set high) of the packet being received. The MAC cuts off any bytes received after 2,048 bytes.
$00100000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_ACS                                \ Automatic Pad or CRC Stripping When this bit is set, the MAC strips the Pad or FCS field on the incoming packets only if the value of the length field is less than 1,536 bytes. All received packets with length field greater than or equal to 1,536 bytes are passed to the application without stripping the Pad or FCS field. When this bit is reset, the MAC passes all incoming packets to the application, without any modification. Note: For information about how the settings of CST bit and this bit impact the packet length, see Table 564: Packet Length based on the CST and ACS bits.
$00200000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_CST                                \ CRC stripping for Type packets When this bit is set, the last four bytes (FCS) of all packets of Ether type (type field greater than 1,536) are stripped and dropped before forwarding the packet to the application. This function is not valid when the IP Checksum Engine (Type 1) is enabled in the MAC receiver. This function is valid when Type 2 Checksum Offload Engine is enabled. Note: For information about how the settings of the ACS bit and this bit impact the packet length, see Table 564: Packet Length based on the CST and ACS bits.
$00400000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_S2KP                               \ IEEE 802.3as Support for 2K Packets When this bit is set, the MAC considers all packets with up to 2,000 bytes length as normal packets. When the JE bit is not set, the MAC considers all received packets of size more than 2K bytes as Giant packets. When this bit is reset and the JE bit is not set, the MAC considers all received packets of size more than 1,518 bytes (1,522 bytes for tagged) as giant packets. For more information about how the setting of this bit and the JE bit impact the Giant packet status, see Table 563: Giant Packet Status based on S2KP and JE Bits. Note: When the JE bit is set, setting this bit has no effect on the giant packet status.
$00800000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_GPSLCE                             \ Giant Packet Size Limit Control Enable When this bit is set, the MAC considers the value in GPSL field in ETH_MACECR register to declare a received packet as Giant packet. This field must be programmed to more than 1,518 bytes. Otherwise, the MAC considers 1,518 bytes as giant packet limit. When this bit is reset, the MAC considers a received packet as Giant packet when its size is greater than 1,518 bytes (1522 bytes for tagged packet). The watchdog timeout limit, Jumbo Packet Enable and 2K Packet Enable have higher precedence over this bit, that is the MAC considers a received packet as Giant packet when its size is greater than 9,018 bytes (9,022 bytes for tagged packet) with Jumbo Packet Enabled and greater than 2,000 bytes with 2K Packet Enabled. The watchdog timeout, if enabled, terminates the received packet when watchdog limit is reached. Therefore, the programmed giant packet limit should be less than the watchdog limit to get the giant packet status.
$07000000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_IPG                                \ Inter-Packet Gap These bits control the minimum IPG between packets during transmission. ... This range of minimum IPG is valid in Full-duplex mode. In the Half-duplex mode, the minimum IPG can be configured only for 64-bit times (IPG = 100). Lower values are not considered. When a JAM pattern is being transmitted because of backpressure activation, the MAC does not consider the minimum IPG. The above function (IPG less than 96 bit times) is valid only when EIPGEN bit in ETH_MACECR register is reset. When EIPGEN is set, then the minimum IPG (greater than 96 bit times) is controlled as per the description given in EIPG field in ETH_MACECR register.
$08000000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_IPC                                \ Checksum Offload When set, this bit enables the IPv4 header checksum checking and IPv4 or IPv6 TCP, UDP, or ICMP payload checksum checking. When this bit is reset, the COE function in the receiver is disabled. The Layer 3 and Layer 4 Packet Filter feature automatically selects the IPC Full Checksum Offload Engine on the Receive side. When this feature is enabled, you must set the IPC bit.
$70000000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_SARC                               \ Source Address Insertion or Replacement Control This field controls the source address insertion or replacement for all transmitted packets. Bit 30 specifies which MAC Address register (0 or 1) is used for source address insertion or replacement based on the values of Bits[29:28]: Others: Reserved, must not be used. Note: Changes to this field take effect only on the start of a packet. If you write to this register field when a packet is being transmitted, only the subsequent packet can use the updated value, that is, the current packet does not use the updated value.
$80000000 constant ETH_ETH_MACCR_ARPEN                              \ ARP Offload Enable When this bit is set, the MAC can recognize an incoming ARP request packet and schedules the ARP packet for transmission. It forwards the ARP packet to the application and also indicate the events in the RxStatus. When this bit is reset, the MAC receiver does not recognize any ARP packet and indicates them as Type frame in the RxStatus.

$00003fff constant ETH_ETH_MACECR_GPSL                              \ Giant Packet Size Limit If the received packet size is greater than the value programmed in this field in units of bytes, the MAC declares the received packet as Giant packet. The value programmed in this field must be greater than or equal to 1,518 bytes. Any other programmed value is considered as 1,518 bytes. For VLAN tagged packets, the MAC adds 4 bytes to the programmed value. For double VLAN tagged packets, the MAC adds 8 bytes to the programmed value. The value in this field is applicable when the GPSLCE bit is set in ETH_MACCR register.
$00010000 constant ETH_ETH_MACECR_DCRCC                             \ Disable CRC Checking for Received Packets When this bit is set, the MAC receiver does not check the CRC field in the received packets. When this bit is reset, the MAC receiver always checks the CRC field in the received packets.
$00020000 constant ETH_ETH_MACECR_SPEN                              \ Slow Protocol Detection Enable When this bit is set, MAC processes the Slow Protocol packets (Ether Type 0x8809) and provides the Rx status. The MAC discards the Slow Protocol packets with invalid subtypes. When this bit is reset, the MAC forwards all error-free Slow Protocol packets to the application. The MAC considers such packets as normal Type packets.
$00040000 constant ETH_ETH_MACECR_USP                               \ Unicast Slow Protocol Packet Detect When this bit is set, the MAC detects the Slow Protocol packets with unicast address of the station specified in the MAC Address 0 high register (ETH_MACA0HR) and MAC Address 0 low register MAC Address x low register (ETH_MACAxLR). The MAC also detects the Slow Protocol packets with the Slow Protocols multicast address (01-80-C2-00-00-02). When this bit is reset, the MAC detects only Slow Protocol packets with the Slow Protocol multicast address specified in the IEEE 802.3-2008, Section 5.
$01000000 constant ETH_ETH_MACECR_EIPGEN                            \ Extended Inter-Packet Gap Enable When this bit is set, the MAC interprets EIPG field and IPG field in Operating mode configuration register (ETH_MACCR) together as minimum IPG greater than 96 bit times in steps of 8 bit times. When this bit is reset, the MAC ignores EIPG field and interprets IPG field in Operating mode configuration register (ETH_MACCR) as minimum IPG less than or equal to 96 bit times in steps of 8 bit times. Note: The extended Inter-Packet Gap feature must be enabled when operating in Full-duplex mode only. There may be undesirable effects on back-pressure function and frame transmission if it is enabled in Half-duplex mode.
$3e000000 constant ETH_ETH_MACECR_EIPG                              \ Extended Inter-Packet Gap The value in this field is applicable when the EIPGEN bit is set. This field (as Most Significant bits) along with IPG field in Operating mode configuration register (ETH_MACCR), gives the minimum IPG greater than 96 bit times in steps of 8 bit times. For example: EIPG = 0 and IPG = 0 give 104 bit times EIPG = 0 and IPG = 1 give 112 bit times EIPG = 0 and IPG = 2 give 120 bit times .. EIPG = 7 and IPG = 31 give 2144 bit times

$00000001 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_PR                                \ Promiscuous Mode When this bit is set, the Address Filtering module passes all incoming packets irrespective of the destination or source address. The SA or DA Filter Fails status bits of the Rx Status Word are always cleared when PR is set.
$00000002 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_HUC                               \ Hash Unicast When this bit is set, the MAC performs the destination address filtering of unicast packets according to the Hash table. When this bit is reset, the MAC performs a perfect destination address filtering for unicast packets, that is, it compares the DA field with the values programmed in DA registers.
$00000004 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_HMC                               \ Hash Multicast When this bit is set, the MAC performs the destination address filtering of received multicast packets according to the Hash table. When this bit is reset, the MAC performs the perfect destination address filtering for multicast packets, that is, it compares the DA field with the values programmed in DA registers.
$00000008 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_DAIF                              \ DA Inverse Filtering When this bit is set, the Address Check block operates in inverse filtering mode for the DA address comparison for both unicast and multicast packets. When this bit is reset, normal filtering of packets is performed.
$00000010 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_PM                                \ Pass All Multicast When this bit is set, it indicates that all received packets with a multicast destination address (first bit in the destination address field is '1') are passed. When this bit is reset, filtering of multicast packet depends on HMC bit.
$00000020 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_DBF                               \ Disable Broadcast Packets When this bit is set, the AFM module blocks all incoming broadcast packets. In addition, it overrides all other filter settings. When this bit is reset, the AFM module passes all received broadcast packets.
$000000c0 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_PCF                               \ Pass Control Packets These bits control the forwarding of all control packets (including unicast and multicast Pause packets).
$00000100 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_SAIF                              \ SA Inverse Filtering When this bit is set, the Address Check block operates in the inverse filtering mode for SA address comparison. If the SA of a packet matches the values programmed in the SA registers, it is marked as failing the SA Address filter. When this bit is reset, if the SA of a packet does not match the values programmed in the SA registers, it is marked as failing the SA Address filter.
$00000200 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_SAF                               \ Source Address Filter Enable When this bit is set, the MAC compares the SA field of the received packets with the values programmed in the enabled SA registers. If the comparison fails, the MAC drops the packet. When this bit is reset, the MAC forwards the received packet to the application with updated SAF bit of the Rx Status depending on the SA address comparison. Note: According to the IEEE specification, Bit 47 of the SA is reserved. However, the MAC compares all 48 bits. The software driver should take this into consideration while programming the MAC address registers for SA.
$00000400 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_HPF                               \ Hash or Perfect Filter When this bit is set, the address filter passes a packet if it matches either the perfect filtering or Hash filtering as set by the HMC or HUC bit. When this bit is reset and the HUC or HMC bit is set, the packet is passed only if it matches the Hash filter.
$00010000 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_VTFE                              \ VLAN Tag Filter Enable When this bit is set, the MAC drops the VLAN tagged packets that do not match the VLAN Tag. When this bit is reset, the MAC forwards all packets irrespective of the match status of the VLAN Tag.
$00100000 constant ETH_ETH_MACPFR_IPFE                              \ Layer 3 and Layer 4 Filter Enable When this bit is set, the MAC drops packets that do not match the enabled Layer 3 and Layer 4 filters. If Layer 3 or Layer 4 filters are not enabled for matching, this bit does not have any effect.

This VLAN tag identifier is compared to the 15th and 16th bytes of the packets being received for VLAN packets. The following list describes the bits of this field: Bits[15:13]: User Priority Bit 12: Canonical Format Indicator (CFI) or Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI) Bits[11:0]: VLAN Identifier (VID) field of VLAN tag When the ETV bit is set, only the VID is used for comparison. If this field ([11:0] if ETV is set) is all zeros, the MAC does not check the 15th and 16th bytes for VLAN tag comparison and declares all packets with Type field value of 0x8100 or 0x88a8 as VLAN packets.

Bits[11:0] of VLAN tag are compared with the corresponding field in the received VLAN-tagged packet. Similarly, when enabled, only 12 bits of the VLAN tag in the received packet are used for Hash-based VLAN filtering. When this bit is reset, all 16 bits of the 15th and 16th bytes of the received VLAN packet are used for comparison and VLAN Hash filtering.

Full-Duplex mode: this bit should be read as 0 before writing to this register. To initiate a Pause packet, the application must set this bit to 1. During Control packet transfer, this bit continues to be set to indicate that a packet transmission is in progress. When Pause packet transmission is complete, the MAC resets this bit to 0. You should not write to this register until this bit is cleared. Half-duplex mode: When this bit is set (and TFE bit is set) in the Half-duplex mode, the MAC asserts the backpressure. During backpressure, when the MAC receives a new packet, the transmitter starts sending a JAM pattern resulting in a collision. When the MAC is configured for the Full-duplex mode, the BPA is automatically disabled.

This bit is cleared by a read into this register (or write of 1 when RCWE bit in CSR software control register (ETH_MACCSRSWCR) is set). Note: This bit may not be set if the MAC stops receiving the LPI pattern for a very short duration, such as, less than three clock cycles of CSR clock.
$00000008 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_RLPIEX                           \ Receive LPI Exit When this bit is set, it indicates that the MAC Receiver has stopped receiving the LPI pattern on the MII interface, exited the LPI state, and resumed the normal reception. This bit is cleared by a read into this register (or write of 1 when RCWE bit in CSR software control register (ETH_MACCSRSWCR) is set). Note: This bit may not be set if the MAC stops receiving the LPI pattern for a very short duration, such as, less than three clock cycles of CSR clock.
$00000100 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_TLPIST                           \ Transmit LPI State When this bit is set, it indicates that the MAC is transmitting the LPI pattern on the MII interface.
$00000200 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_RLPIST                           \ Receive LPI State When this bit is set, it indicates that the MAC is receiving the LPI pattern on the MII interface.
$00010000 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_LPIEN                            \ LPI Enable When this bit is set, it instructs the MAC Transmitter to enter the LPI state. When this bit is reset, it instructs the MAC to exit the LPI state and resume normal transmission. This bit is cleared when the LPITXA bit is set and the MAC exits the LPI state because of the arrival of a new packet for transmission.
$00020000 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_PLS                              \ PHY Link Status This bit indicates the link status of the PHY. The MAC Transmitter asserts the LPI pattern only when the link status is up (OKAY) at least for the time indicated by the LPI LS TIMER. When this bit is set, the link is considered to be okay (UP) and when this bit is reset, the link is considered to be down.
$00080000 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_LPITXA                           \ LPI Tx Automate This bit controls the behavior of the MAC when it is entering or coming out of the LPI mode on the Transmit side. If the LPITXA and LPIEN bits are set to 1, the MAC enters the LPI mode only after all outstanding packets (in the core) and pending packets (in the application interface) have been transmitted. The MAC comes out of the LPI mode when the application sends any packet for transmission or the application issues a Tx FIFO Flush command. In addition, the MAC automatically clears the LPIEN bit when it exits the LPI state. If Tx FIFO Flush is set in the FTQ bit of ETH_MTLTxQOMR, when the MAC is in the LPI mode, it exits the LPI mode. When this bit is 0, the LPIEN bit directly controls behavior of the MAC when it is entering or coming out of the LPI mode.
$00100000 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_LPITE                            \ LPI Timer Enable This bit controls the automatic entry of the MAC Transmitter into and exit out of the LPI state. When LPITE, LPITXA and LPIEN bits are set, the MAC Transmitter enters LPI state only when the complete MAC TX data path is IDLE for a period indicated by the ETH_MACLETR register. After entering LPI state, if the data path becomes non-IDLE (due to a new packet being accepted for transmission), the Transmitter exits LPI state but does not clear LPIEN bit. This enables the re-entry into LPI state when it is IDLE again. When LPITE is 0, the LPI Auto timer is disabled and MAC Transmitter enters LPI state based on the settings of LPITXA and LPIEN bit descriptions.
$00200000 constant ETH_ETH_MACLCSR_LPITCSE                          \ LPI Tx Clock Stop Enable When this bit is set, the MAC asserts sbd_tx_clk_gating_ctrl_o signal high after it enters Tx LPI mode to indicate that the Tx clock to MAC can be stopped. When this bit is reset, the MAC does not assert sbd_tx_clk_gating_ctrl_o signal high after it enters Tx LPI mode. If RGMII Interface is selected, the Tx clock is required for transmitting the LPI pattern. The Tx Clock cannot be gated and so the LPITCSE bit cannot be programmed.

The MAC clears this bit after the MDIO frame transfer is completed. Hence the software must not write or change any of the fields in MDIO address register (ETH_MACMDIOAR) and MDIO data register (ETH_MACMDIODR) as long as this bit is set. For write transfers, the application must first write 16-bit data in the MD field (and also RA field when C45E is set) in MDIO data register (ETH_MACMDIODR) register before setting this bit. When C45E is set, it should also write into the RA field of MDIO data register (ETH_MACMDIODR) before initiating a read transfer. When a read transfer is completed (MII busy=0), the data read from the PHY register is valid in the MD field of the MDIO data register (ETH_MACMDIODR).

When Bit 11 is set, you can achieve a higher frequency of the MDC clock than the frequency limit of 2.5 MHz (specified in the IEEE 802.3) and program a clock divider of lower value.

Note: In the binary rollover mode, the PPS output (eth_ptp_pps_out) has a duty cycle of 50 percent with these frequencies. In the digital rollover mode, the PPS output frequency is an average number. The actual clock is of different frequency that gets synchronized every second. For example: When PPSCTRL = 0001, the PPS (1 Hz) has a low period of 537 ms and a high period of 463 ms When PPSCTRL = 0010, the PPS (2 Hz) is a sequence of One clock of 50 percent duty cycle and 537 ms period Second clock of 463 ms period (268 ms low and 195 ms high) When PPSCTRL = 0011, the PPS (4 Hz) is a sequence of Three clocks of 50 percent duty cycle and 268 ms period Fourth clock of 195 ms period (134 ms low and 61 ms high) This behavior is because of the non-linear toggling of bits in the digital rollover mode in the ETH_MACSTNR register.

When the command is transferred or synchronized to the PTP clock domain, these bits get cleared automatically. The software should ensure that these bits are programmed only when they are all zero. The following list describes the values of PPSCMD0: This command generates single pulse rising at the start point defined in Target Time Registers (register 455 and 456) and of a duration defined in the PPS Width Register. This command generates the train of pulses rising at the start point defined in the Target Time Registers and of a duration defined in the PPS Width Register and repeated at interval defined in the PPS Interval Register. By default, the PPS pulse train is free-running unless stopped by the 'Stop Pulse train at time' or 'Stop Pulse Train immediately' commands. This command cancels the START Single Pulse and START Pulse Train commands if the system time has not crossed the programmed start time. This command stops the train of pulses initiated by the START Pulse Train command (PPSCMD[3:0] = 0010) after the time programmed in the Target Time registers elapses. This command immediately stops the train of pulses initiated by the START Pulse Train command (PPSCMD[3:0] = 0010).

Therefore, all the data in the Tx queue is lost or flushed. This bit is internally reset when the flushing operation is complete. Until this bit is reset, you should not write to the ETH_MTLTXQOMR register. The data which is already accepted by the MAC transmitter is not flushed. It is scheduled for transmission and results in underflow and runt packet transmission.

When this bit remains set and the DMA is re-started by the software driver, the packets residing in the Rx Queues that were received when this RxDMA was stopped, are flushed out. The packets that are received by the MAC after the RxDMA is re-started are routed to the RxDMA. The flushing happens on the Read side of the Rx queue. When this bit is set to 0 the Ethernet peripheral does not flush the packet in the Rx queue destined to DMA Rx Channel after the DMA is stopped due to a system bus error.

Note: The stopping of packet flow from a Rx DMA Channel to the application by setting RPF works only when there is one-to-one mapping of Rx Queue to Rx DMA channels. In Dynamic mapping mode, setting RPF bit in ETH_DMACRXCR register might flush packets from unintended Rx Queues which are destined to the stopped Rx DMA Channel.

The watchdog timer is triggered with the programmed value after the Rx DMA completes the transfer of a packet for which the RI bit is not set in the ETH_DMACSR, because of the setting of Interrupt Enable bit in the corresponding descriptor RDES3[30]. When the watchdog timer runs out, the RI bit is set and the timer is stopped. The watchdog timer is reset when the RI bit is set high because of automatic setting of RI as per the Interrupt Enable bit RDES3[30] of any received packet.
