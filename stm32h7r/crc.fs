[ifndef] CRC_DEF

  [ifdef] CRC_CRC_DR_DEF
    \
    \ @brief CRC data register
    \ Address offset: 0x00
    \ Reset value: 0xFFFFFFFF
    \
    $00 constant CRC_DR                         \ [0x00 : 32] Data register bits This register is used to write new data to the CRC calculator. It holds the previous CRC calculation result when it is read. If the data size is less than 32 bits, the least significant bits are used to write/read the correct value.
  [then]


  [ifdef] CRC_CRC_IDR_DEF
    \
    \ @brief CRC independent data register
    \ Address offset: 0x04
    \ Reset value: 0x00000000
    \
    $00 constant CRC_IDR                        \ [0x00 : 32] General-purpose 32-bit data register bits These bits can be used as a temporary storage location for four bytes. This register is not affected by CRC resets generated by the RESET bit in the CRC_CR register
  [then]


  [ifdef] CRC_CRC_CR_DEF
    \
    \ @brief CRC control register
    \ Address offset: 0x08
    \ Reset value: 0x00000000
    \
    $00 constant CRC_RESET                      \ [0x00] RESET bit This bit is set by software to reset the CRC calculation unit and set the data register to the value stored in the CRC_INIT register. This bit can only be set, it is automatically cleared by hardware
    $03 constant CRC_POLYSIZE                   \ [0x03 : 2] Polynomial size These bits control the size of the polynomial.
    $05 constant CRC_REV_IN                     \ [0x05 : 2] Reverse input data This bitfield controls the reversal of the bit order of the input data
    $07 constant CRC_REV_OUT                    \ [0x07] Reverse output data This bit controls the reversal of the bit order of the output data.
  [then]


  [ifdef] CRC_CRC_INIT_DEF
    \
    \ @brief CRC initial value
    \ Address offset: 0x10
    \ Reset value: 0xFFFFFFFF
    \
    $00 constant CRC_CRC_INIT                   \ [0x00 : 32] Programmable initial CRC value This register is used to write the CRC initial value.
  [then]


  [ifdef] CRC_CRC_POL_DEF
    \
    \ @brief CRC polynomial
    \ Address offset: 0x14
    \ Reset value: 0x04C11DB7
    \
    $00 constant CRC_POL                        \ [0x00 : 32] Programmable polynomial This register is used to write the coefficients of the polynomial to be used for CRC calculation. If the polynomial size is less than 32 bits, the least significant bits have to be used to program the correct value.
